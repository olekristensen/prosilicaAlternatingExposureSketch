This is a short openFrameworks sketch that attempts to use photometric parameters for an Allied Vision Technologies Prosilica GX 1920 camera.

It is a first attempt at doing continuously alternating exposures 3 steps apart for on-the fly 1080p HDR video capture.

It functions as a very simple openFrameworks based sketch for the Longing Fast Forward Research Station software - as such it is unoptimised, slow and not very clever, but is kept nonetheless, in case someone would like to have a look at the proposed ofxVideoGrabberProsilica ofAddon embedded in the project.

To work as intended it should operate at a continuous rate of 50fps resulting in a 25 fps HDR video. This requires accurate timing of the camera code, and for now another path is taken outside of openFrameworks. Later the ofxVideoGrabberProsilica should be updated to take advantage of precise timing allowing for 50fps video with precise control.
